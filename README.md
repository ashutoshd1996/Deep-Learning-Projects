### Deep-Learning-project-Rice-Classfication

This project aims to classify images of Rice grains into types of Rice using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

It consists of the following steps :

1. Downloading the dataset
2. Importing the dataset using PyTorch
3. Exploring the dataset
4. Prepare the dataset for training
5. Create a Neural Network Model
6. Train the model
7. Plot Accuracies and Loss
8. Test the model with the random sample from the dataset
